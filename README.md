# FoodTime



## Context 
This is the starter code for a simple app that gives users dining recommendations. The app should show a user a random type of food and associated image, and have buttons that allow the user to search their area for that type of food, or to search the internet to find out more about it. A second activity should allow the user to customize the list from which foods are chosen. 

Details about the app can be found in the assignment instructions, found on LEA.
